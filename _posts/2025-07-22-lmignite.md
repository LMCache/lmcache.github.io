**TL;DR:** 
LLMs are transforming every product and serviceâ€”from chatbots and copilots to intelligent document search and enterprise workflows. But running LLMs in production is still **painfully slow, prohibitively expensive, and complex to manage**.
That changes today.

Weâ€™re excited to announce the launch of **LMIgnite** â€” the first **one-click** deployable **high-performance** LLM inference backend for Conversational and Long-Document AI. Built on the powerful combination of [vLLM Production Stack](https://github.com/vllm-project/production-stack) and [LMCache](https://github.com/LMCache/LMCache), LMIgnite is purpose-built to accelerate, scale, and simplify LLM serving, especially for conversational AI (e.g., chatbots) or long-document AI (e.g., document analysis).  


## Why LLM Inference Needs a Rethink
While training LLMs captures headlines, **inference is where the real bottlenecks lie:**

- **Slow:** Long context windows and complex reasoning increase latency.
- **Expensive:** Inference cost scales with every input and output tokenâ€”unlike training, which is a one-time cost.
- **Hard to self-host:** Current open-source tools require stitching together multiple components and require experts to do so.
- **Lack of support for latest models:** The rapid release of new models (~1 every 4 days in 2025!) makes support brittle.

Itâ€™s clear we need an inference stack that is

- Fast and cost-efficient
- Dead simple to deploy
- Self-host on any GPU cloud or on-prem servers

## Meet LMIgnite
LMIgnite is the first complete solution that hits all four marks.

It brings together:
- **LMCache**: A research-driven KV cache backend and transfer layer that delivers cutting-edge performance.
- **vLLM Production Stack**: A robust, scalable, and Kubernetes-native system for running distributed vLLM clusters with LLM workload intelligent routing.
- **One-click Deployment**: No infrastructure headaches. Launch in minutes via SkyPilot or our custom UI.

## Unmatched Performance, Backed by Research

LMIgnite delivers up to **10Ã— speedup and cost savings** compared to both open-source and commercial inference solutions like Dynamo, RayServe, Fireworks, and DeepInfra.

The secret? **KV cache-native optimizations** proven in top research venues:

- **Highly optimized KV cache loading** (LMCache): Efficiently stores and loads KV cache between CPU and GPU, minimizing memory bottlenecks.
- **KV Cache Compression** ([SIGCOMM '24](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3623664.3645632)): Shares cache across nodes with minimal bandwidth, enabling distributed efficiency.
- **KV Cache Blending** ([EuroSys '25 Best Paper](https://www.eurosys.org/news/2025-best-paper)): Seamlessly merges previous document queries for smarter, more accurate retrieval-augmented generation (RAG).
- **KV Cache-Aware Routing** (vLLM Production Stack): Intelligently routes requests to reduce redundant prefill computation and maximize cache reuse.
- **NIXL-based Disaggregation** (LMCache): Unlocks flexible compute and memory coordination across the cluster, decoupling storage and compute for maximum scalability.

Together, these innovations let LMIgnite **reuse KV cache** instead of reprocessing raw tokensâ€”just as model weights capture knowledge after training, the cache captures and reuses computation for blazing-fast inference.

## Deploy Anywhere, Effortlessly
LMIgnite runs on any cloud provider (GCP, Lambda, etc.) via [SkyPilot](https://github.com/skypilot-org/skypilot) with:
- 1-click cluster deployment
- 1-click LLM deployment
- Performance dashboard
- Full observability
- vLLM upstream compatibility
